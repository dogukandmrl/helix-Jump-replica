# helix-Jump-replica
Helix jump game is one of the best selling games in mobile game markets. In this project, a replica of the helix jump game was made in order to learn how to design a hyper casual game.
You can access all codes and models from the asset folder.
If I'm going to talk about the helix jump game briefly, you are trying to collect points by passing a ball through the holes. The game is played with simple mouse controls.
The floor with different color will say the game is over and it will start the game again.
Each time the ball dodges a hole, 1 point will be added to your line.
The ball bounces on colorless floors and never disappears on those floors.
